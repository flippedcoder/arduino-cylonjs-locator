# Dog Locator

A simple Arduino IoT device you can use to find your dog or something else programmed with JavaScript

## Basic set up

1. Start your Arduino with the Standard Firmata uploaded from the Aruduino IDE
2. Run `npm install` in the project directory
3. Run `npm start` in your project directory

I have a way more detailed set up guide/tutorial for this coming soon.
